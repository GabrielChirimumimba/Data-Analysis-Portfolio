# [Project 1: Stock and Sales Dashboard  For Store] LINK https://github.com/GabrielKonig/Data-Analysis-Projects

As Junior Database Manager at Ruzvidzo Store I built a dashboard Using Tableau and MS SQL and Excel to present Stock data
in a visually appealling and easily comprehended appearance.

Through the use of Tableau, Excel, and SQL in our store, our sales dashboard provided tangible 
results. We observed a 23% increase in revenue within the first quarter of implementation, attributed to 
informed decision-making driven by the dashboard insights. Additionally, identifying the top-selling items through the dashboard allowed us to 
strategically promote these items, leading to a 15% increase in the sale of high-margin products.

*Data was taken from excel records and entered into SQL
*The model used both contenet based filtering techniques and collaborative filtering techniques
