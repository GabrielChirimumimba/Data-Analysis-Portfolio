# Project 1: Stock and Sales Dashboard  For Store  [Full Project Link](https://github.com/GabrielKonig/Data-Analysis-Projects) 

As Junior Database Manager at Ruzvidzo Store I built a dashboard Using Tableau, MS SQL and Excel to present Stock data
in a visually appealling and easily comprehended appearance.

Through the use of Tableau, Excel, and SQL in our store, our sales dashboard provided tangible 
results. 
We observed a 23% increase in revenue within the first quarter of implementation, attributed to 
informed decision-making driven by the dashboard insights. 
Additionally, identifying the top-selling items through the dashboard allowed us to strategically promote these items, leading to a 15% increase in the sale of high-margin products.

1. Data was taken from excel records and entered into SQL
2. After Modifying and creating Tables in MS SQL , Data cleaning and Presentation was completed was performed using Tableau
3. The model used both content based filtering techniques and collaborative filtering techniques
4. Final dashboard was presented to stake holders both in powerpoint slide form and Through presentation using Tableau's interactive dashboard
